## 🧠 What Skiing Taught Me

Competing at this level isn’t just physical — it’s systems thinking in motion:

- **Precision under pressure**: Every turn and aerial move is a calculated decision under milliseconds.
- **Discipline and feedback**: Training 6+ days a week while finishing college by 16 demanded elite time management and rapid feedback loops — skills I now apply to AI and engineering work.
- **Team mindset**: Whether building a startup tool or chasing a podium, I know how to perform while uplifting teammates around me.

## 🎯 Next Goals

- Continue competing internationally during the 2025–2026 FIS season
- Represent Spain in more European-level events

> I bring the same mindset to Dartmouth that I bring to the mogul course: sharp focus, relentless drive, and the ability to adapt fast and perform under pressure.
